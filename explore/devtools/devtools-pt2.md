1. The bug for the addition calculator was that the num1 and num2 variables were storing the inputted values as strings and not integers. Therefore when we got into the calculateSum() function, we were not doing a mathematical operation like 1 + 2 = 3, but we were doing string concatenation of '1' + '2' = '12'. 
2. Since the issue is that the num1 and num2 variables are being stored as strings instead of integers, when we are assigning the value of both num1 and num2, I encapsulate the code that grabs the data from the website in a parseInt() function in order to convert the string into an integer. So we know that in order to get the data inputted by the user on the website we use the code "document.getElementById("num1/2").value;" and because this code returns a string I just encapsulate it in a parseInt like 
parseInt(document.getElementById("num1/2").value); for both the num1 and num2 variables and thus they turn into integers and proper mathematical arithmetic can be done.
